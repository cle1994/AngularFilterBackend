I was given a challenge - for an interview - of filtering through 3 data sets,
obtained from a get request, and displaying them to be filtered. 
This is a replicated backend I abstracted as to not break the integrity of
the original problem.

I chose to use Angular's powerful filtering and views to create a single page
application.

You can access the api endpoints at the following urls:
